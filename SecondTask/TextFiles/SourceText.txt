Some scientists say that			without computers it would be difficult to live (in the 21st century). Today they are
running our factories, planning our cities, teaching our children and forecasting our future! The computer
solves in seconds the problems that a generation of mathematicians would need months or years to solve without
its help. The degree to which computers take over human functions may frighten some people and astonish others.
If we are to believe some forecasts, computers,		 like the telephone or electricity, may become a common everyday 
thing used by almost everybody. They can even enter our home life!!! Computers help to make a person's shopping list,
remind someone of important appointments and anniversaries and answer the telephone. It's often heard that the
increasing flood of information will be one of the problems of the 21st century but a computer may 
help solve it too. In a computerized library of the future request for information will be answered instantly and
